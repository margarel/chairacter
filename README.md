## Project Idea
We are developing a functional MBTI test for the general public that connects communities and social circles together.

MBTI, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is a popular personality test that categorizes people into 16 different personality types, which provides insights into peopleâ€™s personality preferences and tendencies. While there is a lack of scientific backing to the test, it provides an interactive way for people to bond over similar or different aspects.

We want to focus on creating a functional prototype through HTML, CSS, and JS that allows users to share their results with communities and social circles. Using a design system and the atomic design structure, this prototype will not only help us understand the design process from a visual design perspective, but also the hand-off to developers when building the website as the goal is to create something that the community can take and share with others.
